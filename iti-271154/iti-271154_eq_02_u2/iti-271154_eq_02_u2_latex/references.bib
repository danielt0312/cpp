	of two semiconductor lasers with optoelectronic feedback. The systems
	exhibit broadband chaotic intensity oscillations whose dynamical
	dimension generally increases with the time delay in the feedback
	loop. We explore the robustness of this synchronization with parameter
	mismatch in the lasers, with mismatch in the optoelectronic feedback
	delay, and with the strength of the coupling between the systems.
	Synchronization is robust to mismatches between the intrinsic parameters
	of the lasers, but it is sensitive to mismatches of the time delay
	in the transmitter and receiver feedback loops. An open-loop receiver
	configuration Is suggested, eliminating feedback delay mismatch issues.
	Communication strategies for arbitrary amplitude of modulation onto
	the chaotic signals are discussed, and the bit-error rate for one
	such scheme is evaluated as a function of noise in the optical channel.

	with the potential of providing a high level of robustness and privacy
	in data transmission(1,2). Laboratory demonstrations of chaos-based
	optical communications have already shown the potential of this technology(3-5),
	but a field experiment using commercial optical networks has not
	been undertaken so far. Here we demonstrate high-speed long-distance
	communication based on chaos synchronization over a commercial fibre-optic
	channel. An optical carrier wave generated by a chaotic laser is
	used to encode a message for transmission over 120 km of optical
	fibre in the metropolitan area network of Athens, Greece. The message
	is decoded using an appropriate second laser which, by synchronizing
	with the chaotic carrier, allows for the separation of the carrier
	and the message. Transmission rates in the gigabit per second range
	are achieved, with corresponding bit-error rates below 10(-7). The
	system uses matched pairs of semiconductor lasers as chaotic emitters
	and receivers, and off-the-shelf fibre-optic telecommunication components.
	Our results show that information can be transmitted at high bit
	rates using deterministic chaos in a manner that is robust to perturbations
	and channel disturbances unavoidable under real-world conditions.

  abstract = {We report an experimental study of fast chaotic dynamics in a delay
	dynamical system. The system is an electronic device consisting of
	a length of coaxial cable terminated on one end with a diode and
	on the other with a negative resistor. When the negative resistance
	is large, the system evolves to a steady state. As the negative resistance
	is decreased, a Hopf bifurcation occurs. By varying the length of
	the transmission line we observe Hopf frequencies from 7-53 MHz.
	With the transmission line length fixed, we observe a period doubling
	route to chaos as the negative resistance is further reduced providing
	the first experimental confirmation of an existing theoretical model
	for nonlinear dynamics in transmission line oscillators [Corti ,
	IEEE Trans. Circ. Syst., I: Fundam. Theory Appl. 41, 730 (1994)].
	However, other experimental results indicate limitations to this
	model including an inability to predict the Hopf frequency or to
	produce realistic continuous wave forms. We extend the model to include
	finite bandwidth effects present in a real negative resistor. The
	resulting model is a neutral delay differential equation that provides
	better agreement with experimental results. (C) 2004 American Institute
